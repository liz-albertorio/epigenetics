# Exploring Epigenetic Regulation Using an Online Genome Viewer

**By Liz Albertorio-Sáez, M.Sc. and Rebekah Picard, B.Sc.**

## Abstract

Chromatin mapping is a powerful approach for investigating how genes are epigenetically regulated in different cell types. One way scientists visualize this data is by using genome browsers like IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer), which is freely available to the public. In this activity, students will explore real chromatin mapping data from histone modifications (PTMs), specifically H3K4me3 (associated with gene activation) and H3K27me3 (associated with gene repression).

Two datasets are used: one comparing histone PTMs across human cancer cell lines, and another comparing fibroblasts vs. brain cells. By analyzing how histone PTMs differ across these samples, students will understand how scientists study epigenetics.

## Introduction

The human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs, organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Rather than existing in a rigid form, this genetic material is packaged as chromatin—DNA wrapped around histone proteins to form nucleosomes. This organization enables DNA compaction while still allowing selective gene access.

Chromatin's structure and modifications regulate gene activity, even when the DNA sequence remains constant. With fully sequenced human and mouse genomes, researchers now examine how histone modifications regulate genes across tissues and disease states like cancer.

In this activity, students will:
- Use IGV to explore histone PTMs across cancer cell lines.
- Compare gene activity in NIH3T3 fibroblasts vs. brain cells.
- Identify H3K4me3 (activation; sharp peaks at promoters) and H3K27me3 (repression; broad gene-body coverage).

## Getting Started with IGV: Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Download IGV Browser with Java**  
   Visit [https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) and choose the correct version for your operating system.

2. **Download the chromatin mapping data folder provided with this activity.**

3. **Open IGV.**

4. **Set Genome:**  
   Use the dropdown to select:  
   `Human (GRCH37/hg19)`

5. **Unzip the data folder.**  
   Drag and drop `.bw` (BigWig) files into IGV.

6. **Organize your tracks:**  
   - Order by PTM: `IgG → H3K4me3 → H3K27me3`  
   - Then by cell line: `K562 → Jurkat → MV411 → MCF7`

7. **Fit data to window:**  
   Use `Tracks → Fit Data to Window`.

8. **Assign colors:**  
   - Select tracks by PTM group  
   - Right-click → Change Track Color:  
     - IgG = gray  
     - H3K4me3 = green  
     - H3K27me3 = red

9. **Use the IGV search bar**  
   Explore genes or chromosomes using the dropdown menu or type box.

## Interpreting the IGV Tracks

- **IgG**: Negative control (background signal)
- **H3K4me3**: Sharp peaks at active gene promoters
- **H3K27me3**: Broad peaks across silenced gene bodies
- **Exclusion list regions**: Appear blank; common and expected

**Track Scaling:**
- Select all tracks of one PTM
- Right-click → `Group Autoscale`
- To reset → `Autoscale`

- `BCR`: Strong H3K4me3 signal in K562  
- `GATA1`: Active in leukemia; regulates red blood cells  
- `HBG1/HBG2`: Fetal hemoglobin genes reactivated in leukemia

**Jurkat (T-cell Leukemia)**
- `MN1`: Overexpressed in poor prognosis  
- `CLK1`: Disrupts cell death, enhances migration  
- `TCF7`: Key to T-cell fate, often misregulated

**MV411 (Acute Myeloid Leukemia)**
- `FLT3`: Upregulated in AML; drives cell division  
- `CEBPA`: Myeloid maturation regulator  
- `HOXA9`: Stem cell-like activity when misregulated

**MCF7 (Breast Cancer)**
- `RND3`: Inflammation and migration regulator  
- `ESR1`: Estrogen receptor gene, cancer driver  
- `GRHL2`: Metastasis and epithelial growth regulator

### Part 2: Gene Analysis

Choose one gene from each cancer cell line and analyze the chromatin marks using IGV.

### Part 3: Reflection

- What trends did you observe in gene regulation?
- Why are some genes active in one cell line but not others?
- How do histone modifications contribute to disease?
- What experiment would you design using chromatin mapping?

**Optional Questions**
- Why is studying DNA sequence alone insufficient?
- How is chromatin like a library?
- What are the pros and cons of IGV in the classroom?
- How does this help us understand cancer?
